title: "Web Scraping with python: From HTML Soup to Tidy Data"
date: 2020-11-19 # Make sure the date is in this format
time: "3:00 - 5:00 PM"
event_type: "workshop"
presenters: "Sami Friedrich" 
keywords: ["python", "webscraping", "html", "data extraction", "web harvesting"] 
location: "virtual"
description: "The internet is overflowing with data ripe for harvesting. The challenge is that not all of that data is formatted neatly or easily accessible. Enter the web scraping multitool! With the power of web scraping, the contents of virtually any webpage can be transformed into analysis-ready data. During this workshop, you’ll learn using python how to:
 
1. Scavenge the contents of an HTML webpage
2. Extract only the data you want
3. Format the data into a table
 
Web scraping is exciting not only because it feels like you’re hacking the internet, it also makes you a more resourceful data scientist by allowing you to build novel datasets from a wider array of sources. Web scraping also lends itself to automation, enabling you to update dynamic datasets over time with minimal effort.
 
In this workshop, we’ll be scraping data related to two of Portland’s favorite things: craft beer and Powell’s Books. Please join us for an afternoon of data scavenging fun!
 
All OHSU community members and friends are welcome!  Some basic python knowledge (looping through list elements, passing arguments to functions, writing basic functions) is a prerequisite for this workshop. If you are new to python or want to brush up on these topics before the workshop, check out these free tutorials:

We will also be working with HTML, but no prior experience is necessary.  However, it will be helpful to have a surface-level understanding of HTML elements - namely, their open/close tag structure, and how they nest within each other. If you are not familiar with HTML elements or tags, please take a look at this short overview on HTML Basics before the workshop:"
